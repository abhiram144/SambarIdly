				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wedding night is something every girl anxiously waits for! There are thousands of questions about it in her mind which finally get answered only when the special night comes. However, there are some things which every bride should know or take care of before her first night! In this article, we are listing out 10 such important things that every bride must take into consideration!</p>
<p><strong>1. Bury your past!</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_174330" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-174330" src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/romantic3.gif" alt="" width="599" height="248" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://68.media.tumblr.com/731fd3c71474c413f8f22f0aaae0cc9c/tumblr_n1f84lG9A21tqs1heo1_500.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the key to a good and healthy relationship. No matter how good or bad your past was, flush it off before entering this new phase of life and never let it come between you two otherwise all will be ruined. Even though there’s a good companionship between you and your husband and you don’t mind sharing even the worst things, talking about past even in casual conversation will spoil your relation, believe me! Even more importantly, don’t make a comparison or else you will never have a loving relationship. Remember that this special night is about just you and him!</p>
<p><strong>2. Don’t try to make it perfect! It just needs to be special!</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_174329" style="width: 596px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-174329" src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/romantic2.gif" alt="" width="596" height="254" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.easyweddings.com.au/articles/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/07/wedding-bed.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>We all plan a lot for the big day of wedding and so is the case with the first night. However, here you don’t need to plan much and just make yourself go with the flow. There’s no mantra to make the wedding night perfect but there are a lot of ways to make it special! Get as much intimate as possible and don’t hesitate from being experimental. Express your love instead of thinking that he would get it himself. Remember that he might also be nervous and thousands of nights will be there now.</p>
<p><strong>3. Accept that it will be little awkward for both of you!</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_174335" style="width: 540px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-174335" src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/romantic8.gif" alt="" width="540" height="304" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vcXTL4qbLXMT9I9JU2VwRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NDAwO2g9MjI1/http://38.media.tumblr.com/100fa71d4178ebbf2dc3ee2e44e2f8bf/tumblr_nsgpt8GjZr1s377p6o1_400.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of how much you both know each other before marriage, your first night is going to be little awkward and that’s completely normal. You may feel uncomfortable while he undresses you or his first touch might tickle you from within, that heavy lehenga might become unmanageable or your lingerie may snap or things might be unpredictable. Whatever, just take a deep breath and relax! It’s his first night too and things are very much new for him as well!</p>
<p><strong>4. Your outfit should be sexy yet comfy!</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_174333" style="width: 557px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-174333" src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/romantic6.gif" alt="" width="557" height="312" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://68.media.tumblr.com/1e350dd8ed46d404c8ce5272dd96357b/tumblr_inline_od3bamN0wc1tpxl4l_500.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you are not comfortable, you can’t enjoy it! So make sure that the lingerie you select for the special night fits you properly and you feel confident in it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Don’t expect a flawless wedding night &amp; keep expectations low!</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_174328" style="width: 586px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-174328" src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/romantic1.gif" alt="" width="586" height="329" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://cf.kizlarsoruyor.com/a47988/268dc09c-463c-453a-89d5-4ff08d214db9.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As we mentioned above that things will definitely be awkward and you can’t make it perfect, it would be a wise idea to set your expectations low. Obviously, it will be the most memorable night of your life but many other nights will come which may be better and more perfect than this, so just focus on making it beautiful and unforgettable!</p>
<p><strong>6. First night is not about sex at all!</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_174336" style="width: 599px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-174336" src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/romantic9.gif" alt="" width="599" height="322" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://m.popkey.co/208c9b/3Dr15.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s the beginning of a journey which you two start together and there’s a long way to go! Wedding night is the best time when you can come closer and know each other. It’s not just about physical intimacy but being the soulmates so if you didn’t have a good sex on the first night, it’s not the end of your married life!</p>
<p><strong>7. Sex might hurt! Mentally prepare yourself for little pain!</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_174331" style="width: 521px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-174331" src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/romantic4.gif" alt="" width="521" height="299" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://popxo-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/2016/11/17-wedding-night.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you are a virgin, you might bleed and if you have never done it before, it will certainly hurt. Even if you have done it in the past, it might be different and little painful with a new person so mentally prepare yourself for it. If it’s too painful, take a deep breath and little rest. Give it a try the next night or nights coming here on.</p>
<p><strong>8. You will learn slowly! Don’t underestimate yourself if you can’t do it well in the first time!</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_174332" style="width: 460px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-174332" src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/romantic5.gif" alt="" width="460" height="259" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://www.heroesandheartbreakers.com/images/stories/blogarticles/2016/May2016/outlander-hot_500.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many girls feel that they have been doing it all wrong and hence, can’t enjoy or cherish the moment in the hope to make it perfect, as they watched in movies but this is real life and things don’t always go as you plan! You might be tired due to hectic rituals and may simply want some rest. Don’t unnecessarily push yourself; it’s just the beginning!</p>
<p><strong>9. You can’t know everything!</strong></p>
<figure id="attachment_174395" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-174395" src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/romantic-gif-13.gif" alt="" width="600" height="336" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://gifimage.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/romantic-gif-13.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of how much you read about the wedding night or whatever you have watched in films or adult movies, this all is not enough and accept that you can’t know everything about it instantly. You will learn along the way and give yourself ample time; after all, you both have thousands of nights here on!</p>
<p><strong>10. It’s a good idea to clear doubts with mentor!</strong></p>
<p>Every girl has a mentor who teaches her what to do and what not to do, be it her mother, elder sister or any woman who is married. Brace yourself with all the wisdom and don’t hesitate in clearing doubts or asking for some tips! This will help a lot!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gurmeet Ram Rahim was announced guilty on the historic day of 25th Aug. The news of Gurmeet being announced as criminal by CBI court made everyone happy. It was learnt that Gurmeet was visibly nervous as he was standing in front of the judge inside the court, though a lot about the proceedings was kept private.</p>

<p>We reported to you earlier that how he had made a Bollywood style plan for his escape from the court on the conviction day itself. And now we&#8217;ve learnt about another interesting bit regarding the case.</p>
<p><b>Since Gurmeet was charged for raping his own followers, his counsel disagreed by claiming that he is not physically and mentally fit to have sex with anyone as he was impotent since 1990</b> </p>
<p>Hilarious, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p><b>Have a look at the court papers regarding the matter-</b></p>

<p>However, the CBI court maintained its point and rejected all the disagreements-</p>
<p><b>Special CBI judge Jagdeep Singh, in the conviction order, said:</b></p>
<blockquote><p>“Any statement of rape is an extremely humiliating experience for a woman and until she is a victim of sex crime she would not blame anyone but the real culprit.”</p></blockquote>
<p><b>He added-</b></p>
<blockquote><p>“Any follower, much less the sadhvis, who had been christened by the accused himself, would be the last person in the world to level false allegations against such a person.” </p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_173984" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-ram-rahim-1-600x338.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" class="size-large wp-image-173984" srcset="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-ram-rahim-1-600x338.jpg 600w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-ram-rahim-1-300x169.jpg 300w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-ram-rahim-1-768x432.jpg 768w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-ram-rahim-1-696x392.jpg 696w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-ram-rahim-1-747x420.jpg 747w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-ram-rahim-1.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/08/25/Pictures/files-india-cult-crime-guru_217d50ee-89aa-11e7-a194-d8b7abb7611c.jpg" target="_blank">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p><b>The judge also said that Gurmeet&#8217;s claim is devoid of any merit as he had two daughters. </b></p>
<p>One of the hostel wardens had said that Singh&#8217;s two daughters were staying in the Dera hostel in 1999 and the CBI judge held that given this fact, the claim regarding impotency falls flat.</p>
<p>Rejecting the claim by Gurmeet, he said-</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This very fact speaks volumes about virility of the accused&#8230; at least two daughters have born out of loin of the accused.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Describing Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh as a “wild beast”, the CBI court said that rapists like him “do not deserve any sympathy.”</b></p>
<p>Special judge Jagdeep Singh said that Gurmeet disguising as a religious guru and caused irreparable damage to the &#8220;heritage of the ancient land&#8221; and now he must get a deterrent punishment.</p>
<p><b>Jagdeep said-</b></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;When the convict did not even spare his own pious disciples and acted like wild beast, he does not deserve any mercy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Bashing the disgusting acts of so called religious guru, the court said that Gurmeet does not have any concerns for the humanity, nor does he have any mercy in his nature, which was reflected through his ravishing acts. Such a convict, the judge said, should not expect any leniency from the court in the matter of punishment.</p>
<p>Interesting! Isn&#8217;t it? We hope our judiciary system continues to prove itself strong in the future too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all dream to visit top destinations of the globe and save money for years to take a tour to our favorite places. But how would you react if we say that this amazing cave can make you forget all those world-class destinations for a moment?</p>
<p>Can’t believe it? Well, it won’t be wrong if we say that it’s a paradise nestled beautifully in Vietnam&#8217;s Quang Binh province. We are talking about Hang Son Doong which is one of the most captivating places on the Earth and will entirely bewitch you with its spark.</p>
<figure id="attachment_174362" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-174362" src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cave-1-600x365.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="365" srcset="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cave-1.jpg 600w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/cave-1-300x183.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://www.sondoongcave.org/images/son-doong-cave-gate.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>It was in the year 1990 that a local man Ho Khanh discovered it when he was was looking for a place for shelter. He observed clouds and underground river’s roaring noise but as luck would have it, he lost path while returning and hence, the cave’s precise location was a mystery for 18 years. It was in the year 2008 that he found the entrance point once again as he was looking for food.</p>
<p>Wind’s whistle and the rushing stream’s roar which could be heard from the entrance along with steep descent stopped individuals from discovering it further until it became a globally renowned spot in the year 2010 when a group from British Cave Research Association (BCRA) carried out a survey in Phong Nha-Ke Bang.</p>
<figure id="attachment_174363" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-174363" src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/index-600x384-600x384.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="384" srcset="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/index-600x384.jpg 600w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/index-600x384-300x192.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://oxalis.com.vn/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/index-600x384.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In 2010, BCRA explored the cave and called it the largest one ever! Quite naturally, this discovery took the world to storm and was a historical finding in the world of caving.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Strictness is needed in schools but of course, there must be a limit to it. Teachers should not act like monsters. Children need love, care and attention and not brutal treatment. </p>
<p>We  have often heard that teachers beat students when they do something wrong or when they don’t complete their homework. </p>
<p>However a scary video is being circulated online in which a teacher is seen slapping a class 3 student mercilessly just because he failed to say “Present mam” during roll call.<br />
The most horrific thing is that she slapped him around 40 times in just 2 minutes. </p>
<p>She is mishandling the kid and treating him brutally. Social media is stunned to see this video, which has gone viral in no time. People are sharing it like crazy and slamming the teacher for behaving so badly with the child. </p>
<p>This incident took place in St John Vianney High School, a famous school in Lucknow. If reports are to be believed, the child was so engaged in drawing that he couldn’t hear the teacher calling out his name. On this, the teacher got furious and started slapping him.</p>
<p>Here’s the brutal video;</p>
<div class='embed videoWrapper'><iframe width="696" height="522" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NYxt46SZLcc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>Parents were shocked to see the child with a swollen face. It is due to his friend that they came to know what exactly happened.  The teacher was identified as Retika V John she was immediately terminated.</p>
<p>An FIR has been filed by the parents at PGI police station; let&#8217;s see what happens further. However, this video has given us shivers and it was wrong on the part of teacher to treat students like this.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Bollywood and other movie industries in India are trying their best to innovate cinema with experiments, Bhojpuri cinema remains unchanged as they continue to make cinema which is nothing but unintentional comedy. Except a few filmmakers, all of them are working in the industry just for the sake of it. It would be best to say that they carry the creativity in their pockets and have forgotten to use it. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>25th Aug 2017 was a historic day when Gurmeet Ram Rahim was announced guilty by CBI court for raping two of his own female followers. Soon after the announcement, his followers created riots outside the court in Panchkula including states Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. The riots took the life of around 35 people and 250 approx were injured.</p>
<figure id="attachment_174319" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-1-600x325.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="325" class="size-large wp-image-174319" srcset="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-1-600x325.jpg 600w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-1-300x162.jpg 300w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-1-696x377.jpg 696w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-1.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://static.navodayatimes.in/multimedia/19_20_287379674ram-ll.jpg" target="_blank">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>But if by chance you thought that it was all done purely by his followers then it&#8217;s not 100% true. There were some followers in Panchukla who already claimed that they were called here for what was supposed to be a satsang and they didn&#8217;t have any hint of violence. If that was not enough to understand that people were intentionally misled, here comes something even more explosive.</p>
<p>As per the latest information disclosed by Haryana Police, Gurmeet had escape plans built already while he was in the court on 25th and all the violence was also manufactured. </p>
<p>Inspector General of Police KK Rao told reporters that soon after he was declared guilty by the court on Friday, Gurmeet asked to bring a &#8220;red bag&#8221; from his car which had his clothes. He said-</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The Dera chief demanded the bag, saying his clothes were in it. It was actually a signal for his men to spread the news of his conviction among supporters so that they could resort to causing disturbance.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>The officer reported, As the bag was taken out of the Baba&#8217;s SUV, sounds of tear gas shells were heard about 2-3 km from the court.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;It was then that we understood that there was some meaning behind the signal.&#8221;</i></p>
<p><b>And this is how the bag looked like-</b></p>
<figure id="attachment_174323" style="width: 184px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/red-bag.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="242" class="size-full wp-image-174323" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="https://twitter.com/branbaba/status/901415152947404802" target="_blank">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also Gurmeet and his said daughter, Honeypreet Insan were noticed wasting too much time standing in the corridor which made the police doubtful. The officer explained-</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;They were trying to gain time before sitting in the vehicle so that their men could spread the message that he was moving from the court. They were told that you cannot stand here. The mob was about 2-3 km and could have moved closer. We never wanted violence as casualties could have been more.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is when the cops became really alert and decided to not let him go to the jail in his own car and took him in the government vehicle. And as soon as this happened, Gurmeet&#8217;s personal commandos tried to create a problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>“When we asked Baba to sit the government vehicle, his personal commando surrounded him. The DCP team, who was in charge of moving baba from that place also had an argument with the baba’s commando. We tried to manage the situation with talks as didn’t want any kind of violence to break out there,” </p></blockquote>
<figure id="attachment_174320" style="width: 600px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-2-1-600x375.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="375" class="size-large wp-image-174320" srcset="http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-2-1-600x375.jpg 600w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-2-1-300x187.jpg 300w, http://www.rvcj.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gurmeet-2-1.jpg 647w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/msg-647_082917054055.jpg" target="_blank">Source</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>As per the officer, the Dera chief had Z-plus security from quite a long time and a team of 650 commandos of Haryana police escorted him on his way to the court. He added that the parade following Ram Rahim was not allowed to come near the court premises and was stopped near Suraj Theater in Panchkula.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Since the convoy of 60-70 cars was standing near the theater, we planned to take Ram Rahim from different route after the court’s verdict to avoid any kind of mishap and added that not much people of the security personnel was informed about this.”</p></blockquote>
<p>He further added-</p>
<blockquote><p>“We got a clue that he was planning to escape from the time he asked us to bring the red bag. Secondly, they were just wasting time so that their supporters can take action. He was followed by 60-60 cars what were they doing there? It was needed to handle them tactfully and we did to avoid any major happening.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, isn&#8217;t that what we call a Bollywood style plan? And we are so happy that it felt on its face.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bollywood celebrities are minting millions; they have immense fan following and so, their movies mint crores and crores, when they hit the screens. If their film is earning so much, it’s obvious that even they would be getting a hefty amount at the end.</p>
<p>Last week, Forbes came out with a list of highest paid actors in the world and this time, it is back with the list of highest paid B-Town actors. When we talk of Bollywood, the 3 Khans dominate the industry! </p>
<p>However, we need to see their ranks in 2017 to be able to decide who the highest paid one in the lot is. Their earnings include not only the movie fees, but also their money that they earn from endorsements. The earnings recorded are from the period June 1, 2016 to June 1, 2017. Check out the top 10 list…</p>
<p><strong>1. SRK tops the list with yearly earnings of $38 million (Rs 243 crore). His earnings comprise of film fees, profit of his production house &#8220;Red Chillies&#8221; and also his brand endorsements. </strong></p>

<p>The Hi-End restaurants focus on the &#8220;Art of food.&#8221; The Chefs who work in these restaurants are highly qualified from national and international institutes who try to impress the customers with their creativity. They use high-quality ingredients to cook and serve. The chefs get to showcase their talents and flaunt their skills in front of you. They use different techniques and methodologies to prepare. </p>

<p><strong>The primary motive is to enjoy every bite that you eat. Small portions help to extract pleasure from every bite. You are not spending a lump some amount of money to eat till satiety, but here you will get a novel experience in the field of taste. You will be satisfied but not bloated. If you are eating small portions, then you can eat many other dishes as well. You will enjoy eating and relish a small amount of many food items rather than eating a large amount of one meal. </strong></p>

<p>Budding Food Critic Mudra Keswani expresses her opinion about this-</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Food served at a five-star hotel is of a high-class category. From quality to the presentation. Everything is top notch. While small restaurants compromise on quality which makes food cheaper and therefore leading to differences in quantity. Five-star restaurants aim to cater high-end guests. While small cafes aim to provide middle class and student category. Now naturally there&#8217;ll be quality and quantity difference. But then people go for brands, so it&#8217;s a mixed experience. Some are good while some are bad as well.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The situation in Syria seems to improve in comparison to the circumstances that were prevailing last year. In fact, a photo of a young boy was more than enough to make people understand what the situation in Syria at that time was.</p>
<p>If you remember, this photo of a crying boy laden with debris and blood on his body went viral and made people aware of the really grim situation of Aleppo. He was pulled out of the remains of his house after an airstrike and the photo was clicked when he was sitting in an ambulance. This pic spoke thousand words about the condition of civilians in the war-stricken Syria.</p>

<p>The name of the boy is Omran Daqneesh and his elder brother Ali who was just 10 years old was not so lucky and died in the airstrike.</p>
<p><strong>However, now the family has somewhat recovered from the tragedy and this little boy’s amazing transformation during this period is startling!</strong></p>

<p><strong>His father claimed that the image of Omran was used by the opposition supporters to create propaganda. Here is what he said,</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“I am Mohammad Kheir Daqneesh, the father of the child Omran. We have been in so much turmoil in (Eastern Aleppo) because of the insurgents, and because of the issues they made propaganda of. The child &#8211; thank God- is alright. He had slightly minor injuries.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>He added,</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Thank God, now the situation is improving, the army is advancing and liberated the areas, and we came back to our homes, the situation is now getting better. We were sitting in our house like this. Omran and I were spending time having fun on our cell phones. Then the strike occurred. He ran inside (his room) because of the pressure, and I could see nothing, no light until I heard his voice. I took (Omran) while I was bleeding over him. I put him in a safe room until I could get the family too. I lifted and threw heavy stones until I heard the voice of my elder son. I wanted to search for anyone else.”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>He further talked about it,</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“(The insurgents) started filming him while I was in the house. I came out and asked ‘where are the kids?’ They told me they are at the hospital. They took me with the ambulance. (Omran’s) head was bandaged. Nevertheless, they took him to the hospital just to film him. I was busy in saving my family, while (the insurgents) seized the opportunity and filmed my family when they were getting out the house for the sake of (propaganda).”</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>He also stated,</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“Honest to God, if I knew I was being reported on the media I would have recorded the organisations that came to me. I’ve seen organisations that I have never seen before. I had never taken the so-called ‘aid’ and I have never dealt with such people at all.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We are happy to see Omran smiling and playing because the Syrian kids have seen a lot of bloodshed, something a child should never witness. Hope the same for other kids too!</p>
